The resources worked are extensive and include the use of EC2, RDS, and VPCs, as well as CloudTrail and CloudWatch for logging.

                        In this position I was part of a small team working on a number of varied projects. The main project worked on was a central database and ERP system to manage the business. This project was created using C#, applying code ﬁrst methodologies with Entity Framework, with JavaScript and AngularJS in the frontend.

                    <p>
                        I also worked on several solo side projects including a customer facing system to allow customers to engage with, and respond to a current order. This was created using PHP and JavaScript with jQuery alongside other frameworks.

                    <p>
                        I was also the primary person in charge of the existing company database.

                        My final project in this position was the work on the WordPress plugin 'UpdraftCentral'. This was a plugin which would allow the management of many different WordPress sites from a single site. My work on this was largely front-end, and involved the creation of a mobile and screen responsive front-end, as well as JavaScript with jQuery for user interaction.
